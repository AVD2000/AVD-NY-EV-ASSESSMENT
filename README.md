#OverviewThis script performs data analysis and creates visualization from an Excel dataset provided by NYSERDA (https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/-/media/Project/Nyserda/Files/Publications/Research/Transportation/EValuateNY_v11_pt2.zip) which contains electric vehicle (EV) and charging port data for counties in New York (NY). It focuses on the following key components:BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) on the roadPHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) on the roadEVs (Electric Vehicles) on the roadCharging ports, including DCFC (Direct Current Fast Chargers) and Level 2 charging portsThe ratio of EVs per public charger for each countyThis script uses matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn, to create bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps.     This is done to help in comparing and analyzing the data.#Steps in the ScriptLoading Data:    This script starts by loading the data from the EValuateNY.xlsx Excel file into a pandas DataFrame     called EVNY. The relevant sheet ("Pivot Table") is selected, and the first two rows are skipped while     using "Row Labels" as the index.    Data Conversion and Cleaning:    Converting Columns to Numeric: Certain columns (e.g., BEVs, PHEVs, EVs, and charging ports) are     converted to numeric data types to aid analysis.        Rounding Values: Columns for BEVs, PHEVs, and EVs on the road are rounded to whole numbers.        Cleaning: The DataFrame is cleaned by removing unwanted rows ((blank), Out of State, Unknown,     and Grand Total). Missing values are filled with zeros.    Sorting and Filtering Data:    The DataFrame is sorted by the relevant columns (BEVs, PHEVs, EVs, DCFC ports, and Level 2 ports),     and the top 15 counties for each category are extracted.    Visualizing Data:    Several visualizations are created to better understand and compare the data:               Bar Plots:            Bar plots are created for the top 15 counties in terms of BEVs, PHEVs, EVs, DCFC Ports,             and Level 2 Ports.            For each category, the plot shows the counties on the x-axis and the corresponding number of             vehicles or chargers on the y-axis.                Heatmap:            A heatmap is created to visualize the 'EVs Per Public Charger' ratio for the top 15 counties.                Box Plot:            A box plot is generated to show the distribution and spread of the 'EVs Per Public Charger'             values across all counties.            Calculating Additional Metrics:    A new column 'Total Chargers' is created by adding the number of DCFC and Level 2 ports.        The 'EVs Per Public Charger' ratio is calculated by dividing the total number of EVs on the     road by the total number of chargers available in each county.    Saving the Figures:    Each plot is saved as an image (.png) file, which can be used for further analysis or reporting.#Output FilesThe following image files will be generated and saved:T_15_BEVs_OTR.png - Bar plot for top 15 counties for BEVs on the road.T_15_PHEVs_OTR.png - Bar plot for top 15 counties for PHEVs on the road.T_15_EVs_OTR.png - Bar plot for top 15 counties for EVs on the road.T_15_DCFC_Ports.png - Bar plot for top 15 counties for DCFC Ports.T_15_L2_Ports.png - Bar plot for top 15 counties for Level 2 Ports.EVs_Per_Public_Charger_Heatmap.png - Heatmap for the top 15 counties for EVs per public charger.EVs_Per_Public_Charger_Box_Plot.png - Box plot showing the distribution of EVs per public charger across                                       all counties.
